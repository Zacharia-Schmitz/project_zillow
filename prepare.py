Contains functions to acquire, prepare and split your data. 
You can have other .py files if you desire to abstract other code away from your final report.

Each of your functions are accompanied by descriptive docstrings. 
If they are functions you borrowed from instructors, put those docstrings in your own words.

Functions to acquire and prepare your data should be imported and used in your final report.

Your work must be reproducible by someone with their own env.py file.
